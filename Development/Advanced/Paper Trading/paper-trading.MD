# Paper Trading

Paper trading is the simulation of stock trading using imaginary money. For example, investing a hypothetical $50 in a stock that's worth $0.20 on Monday but grows to $0.30 by Thursday, would lead to an imaginary growth of $18.75. Paper trades assume buying and selling commisions are set at 5%.
